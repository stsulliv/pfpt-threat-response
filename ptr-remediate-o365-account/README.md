Problem Statement
---
The growing number of Cloud Accounts being compromised and the resultiong required remediation steps are creating a resource drain on Security Operations.

Problem Overview
---
There is a separation between security tools that identify compromised accounts and the tools available to remediate compromised accounts. Complete remediation requires a number of steps and can take a considerable amount of time and effort.
The disconnect often exists because security tools identify multiple accounts, remediation tools are designed around remediating a single account.

Project Objective
---
To leverage Targeted Attack Protection (TAP), Threat Response Auto-pull (TRAP) and Windows PowerShell to automate a comprehensive remediation plan.
